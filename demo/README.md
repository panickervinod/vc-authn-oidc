# VC AuthN Demo Applications

This is a demo application that uses vc-authn-oidc as Identity Provider to access a web resource directly, without requiring the use of third-party Access and Identity Management solutions.

## Running the Demo

### Pre-Requisites

This demo requires you to have a mobile wallet installed on your mobile phone. Visit this [page](https://github.com/bcgov/identity-kit-poc/blob/master/docs/GettingApp.md) for guidance on getting your own mobile wallet on iOS or Android.

Once you have the mobile app, you must obtain a `Verified Email` credential from this [Email Verification Service](https://email-verification.vonx.io). Instructions to do that are on the site.

You will also need to have Docker installed and running. Want to run this a&mdash;no Docker needed?  See [these instructions](Running-In-Play-With-Docker.md) about running this in your browser using Play with Docker.

:information_source: If you have publicly accessible endpoints for your agent and controller, you can skip starting ngrok and provide your endpoints when starting the components prefixing the `manage` command with the `NGROK_AGENT_URL` and `NGROK_CONTROLLER_URL` environment variables.

*Example:* ```NGROK_AGENT_URL=${NGROK_AGENT_URL} NGROK_CONTROLLER_URL=${NGROK_CONTROLLER_URL} ./manage start```

### Running the Apps

In addition to the above pre-requirements, you will need three bash shell instances open at the following locations:

1. [vc-authn-oidc/docker](../docker)
2. [demo/docker](./docker)
3. [demo/scripts](./scripts)

Run `./manage build` in shells number `1` and `2` to assemble the images required to run the demo services.

When the builds are completed, run [start-ngrok.sh](./scripts/start-ngrok.sh) in shell number `3`. This will run an instance of `ngrok` used to allow your mobile agent to communicate with the services running on localhost.

Now we can start the services:

- In shell number `1` run ```./manage start-demo```

Once the services are running, we will need to configure vc-authn-oidc so that it will request the `Verified Email` credential. To do this, execute the following command in another shell (you can use, as an example, shell number `2`):

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5000/api/vc-configs" -H "accept: application/json" -H "X-Api-Key: controller-api-key" -H "Content-Type: application/json-patch+json" -d "{\"id\": \"verified-email\",\"subject_identifier\": \"email\", \"configuration\": { \"name\": \"verified-email\", \"version\": \"1.0\", \"requested_attributes\": [ { \"name\": \"email\", \"restrictions\": [ { \"schema_name\": \"verified-email\", \"issuer_did\": \"MTYqmTBoLT7KLP5RNfgK3b\" } ] } ], \"requested_predicates\": [] }}"
```

Additionally, we need to add the valid redirect URI for the test client to the vc-authn-oidc-controller database: a new entry should be created in the `ClientRedirectUris` table. To acquire the credentials to connect to to the database you can refer to the environment variables set in the `controller-db` section of the main [manage](../docker/manage) script, however the default parameters for the demo clients have been pre-configured for convenience.

- In shell number `2` run ```./manage start```

### Try the Demo!

Once the applications have started, navigate your web browser to http://localhost:8080 and try clicking the link to provide a `Verified Email` credential: you will be redirected to a page displaying a QR code generated by `vc-authn-oidc`. If you have previously obtained the `Verified Email` credential, you should be able to scan the code with your mobile wallet app, present the required proof and be able to access the protected page in the web application.
